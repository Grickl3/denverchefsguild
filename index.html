		<h3>Why join us?</h3>
		<p>Currently there are few organizations and networks which value every single food worker regardless of their jobs and inclusively support them in the industry. There is elitism, hierarchy, and ego that impacts the lives and health of all food workers. We are here to serve our community in full transparency. We respect privacy and confidentiality and we are committed to serving everyone — regardless of their positions or status.  Whether you are a porter, restaurateur, prep-cook, dishwasher, line cook, or chef the Denver Chefs Guild is open to you.</p>

		<h3>What We Offer Our Members</h3>
		<p>As a member, you will be a part of a vibrant local digital space which consistently enriches, and supports our local culinary community. Through our electronic newsletter and subscription-based emails you will receive the most up-to-date information on resources and relevant programs that impact your everyday life. As we continue creating space for individuals, employers, and organizations to support the culinary community, we will continue developing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A crowd-sourced database, facilitating connection between Denver-area chefs, employers, and organizations</li>
			<li>Online resource libraries to address the most pressing needs of chefs and food workers</li>
			<li>Methods for fostering a growth mindset in our changing industry</li>
			<li>Efforts to cultivate imagination, innovation, and transformation of kitchen work culture through community</li>
			<li>A platform to publish and discover stories of food workers, chefs, and restaurateurs from different walks of life</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>About US</h3>
		<p>The Denver Chefs Guild stands before you as a coalition of like-minded individuals from around the world, from different walks of life. What binds them together is not their work as chefs but their commitment to the issues surrounding the health and wellness of those who maintain the industry in order to provide healthy, sumptuous food to those whom they serve.</p>
		<p>Five years ago, Anders Benson, a graduate from the Culinary Institute of America, never imagined that he would be starting an organization like this guild. Yet, he felt a deep stirring inside him — a restlessness — that made him thoughtful about the meaning and purpose of the oppressive work environment in the food industry. In 2014, Anders joined Denver Montessori Junior/Senior High School as the Culinary Science Teacher. Through the concepts of physics, chemistry, and biology he unfolded a world of Culinary Arts to his students; he also took classes in permaculture design as well as earned his MA in Education. Through his readings, musings, and interactions with the students, he was inspired to reflect upon the life and world of chefs, and became increasingly uneasy about the lives of the chefs — those who had committed their lives to feeding the mind and body of the community, but were getting depleted of their own strength through physical and emotional burnout. Anders began to question the food that is served on the table — food which is not only a labor of love but the labor of sweat, exploitation, pain, and stress. Anders decided to challenge these systems. He initiated conversations on various issues and ideas connected with the food industry, eventually motivating him to develop a forum for social action.</p>
